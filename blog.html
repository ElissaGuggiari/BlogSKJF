            <h2>11. Swiss choir competition</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Chur. At the weekend from 2nd to 4th. February 2024 the Alpine
                town of Chur hosts the 11th. Swiss choir competition. Graubünden with its long
                and large choir tradition is proud to welcome singers from all over Switzerland.
                The OK is pleased that this event is taking place in Chur and thus Graubünden
                has the opportunity to present his extensive singing work throughout Switzerland
                on this occasion. The choir competition is open to all choirs – regardless of
                their level of performance – and is enriched by the fact that a wide range of
                choirs meet for musical exchange! In addition to the typical Graubünden
                specialties, an exciting supporting program is organized, which, along with
                culinary delights, also provides vocal delicacies on Friday and Saturday
                evenings.
